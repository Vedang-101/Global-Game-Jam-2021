 This Repo contains source code for the game which was developed for Global Game Jam 2021<br>
 The Theme for the GGJ this year was: Lost and Found... This, this was a though one, The idea, after a lot of brainstorming, that we came up with was as follows:<br>
 
 > A mechanic where player will be lost in a vast array of camera feeds and to navigate through a level, the player has to find the lost charecter and navigate him to next
 > level<br>
 
 When discussing this mechanic with the community (gamedev.in) we got many feedbacks and a chance to craft a narrative for the game.<br>
 > The Game features a robber who is stuck on top floor of a building and power went off (except for the elevators) and the only wa to leave the building is to keep on going down
 > the floors, the way he can do it is through CCTV cameras installed on each floor paired various traps such as 'automated cameras' where, if seen on them for more than a few
 > seconds will trigger alarm, similarly 'laser lights' which can trigger alarm is player crosses through them, etc<br>
 
 The game was developed in 48 hours, with sounds interacting with the situation and suiting the game style. The game was submitted and uploaded on itch.io which can be played here:
